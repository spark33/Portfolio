### Dick's Sporting Goods University is a web / mobile experience designed to digitize a coach’s clipboard.

Dick's Sporting Goods is the biggest sports retail company in the US. Now, they were looking for ways to be the **best sports company**, period. They wanted to start by expanding their services outside of retail.

After evaluating over 40 ideas and fully prototyping 5 ideas, we concluded that Dick's Sporting Goods University is a concept that is desirable, feasible and viable for all key stakeholders, including DICK's. Today, the client has established a team to carry this idea forward.

{% include project-image.html src='img/DSG University-1.png' description='' %}

#### Project Overview

The client came to us with an open problem statement, to say the least:	

<blockquote>
	<b>Being a coach is hard.</b>
</blockquote>

They knew **coaches** were central to the athletes' experiences, but they didn't have any offerings to target them. They defined this breakdown using their 'mastery loop' model:

{% include project-image.html src='img/DSG University-3.png' description='The mastery loop describes the journey of a typical athlete / customer' %}

Young athletes get **curious** about new sports and techniques all the time. As they learn more, they get **excited**, and they take this excitement to the DSG store. Purchasing equipment makes them **confident**, and **mastery** in their new sport / technique leads them to new curiosities, completing a cyclic journey.

Coaches were important because as leaders of trainings, coaches had the most influence over athletes getting excited about new concepts. 

**So what gets young athletes excited?**

As you saw in the video, sport celebrities are like gods and goddesses to youth athletes. They look up to them, they dress like them, they want to train like them, they want to **be them.**

**DSG University is a concept designed to deliver this magical excitement to the training ground.**

We found that DSG University would not only deliver better experiences for athletes, but that we would be solving a huge pain point for coaches, who constantly worry about how they can keep their athletes engaged throughout trainings.

Below I summarize my team's journey through these 15 weeks. We summarized our process using as a variation of the famous double diamond model:

{% include project-image.html src='img/DSG University-4.png' description='The team diverged and converged countless times throughout the project.' %}

#### Phase 1: Initial Research

As the team didn't have any prior experience in sports retail, we started with <b>29 stakeholder interviews and 2 store visits</b> to understand more about the stakeholder journeys.

<blockquote>
	<b>Research methods:</b> Literature reviews, competitive analysis, survey, in-person interviews, fly on the wall
	<br />
	<b>Synthesis methods:</b> Affinity diagraming, customer journey map, stakeholder & value flow map
</blockquote>

{% include project-image.html src='img/DSG University-5.png' description='Coaches are at the center of the team, always coordinating with others.' %}

{% include project-image.html src='img/DSG University-6.png' description="We were able to find parallels with DSG's mastery loop. Most athletes drive their own purchases." %}

While we drew some helpful insights, we didn't feel that they were focused enough. There were thousands of different 'kinds' of coaches, based on the sport, athletes' age group, level of competition, etc. We began to see coaches as more of a **'persona group'**, and felt lost on which persona to focus on. We altered our timeline and dove into another research phase.

#### Phase 2: Market Research

To find a focus, we felt we needed to pick the group that would drive the most value to the client. We read up on Dick’s Sporting Goods' direction as a company and overall industry trends.

<blockquote>
	<b>Research methods:</b> Literature reviews, competitive analysis
	<br />
	<b>Synthesis methods:</b> Business potential overview
</blockquote>

As an industry leader, Dick's Sporting Goods already had a model for the landscape called the **"double peak hypothesis"**.

{% include project-image.html src='img/DSG University-7.png' description='Youth athletes and their parents make up most of the sports retail market.' %}

Kids love sports. However, the pressure of academics and employment pushes out of sports until they become parents, and they find sports to be a good way to connect with their kids. 

Dick's Sporting Goods also found that the first peak began declining at 15, and this age was shifting left as kids were adopting a "up or out" mentality: *"If I can't play on the A team, I don't want to play".*

**We saw this as an opportunity:** could we provide a fun experience for these non-competitive youth athletes? We dove into some research to find out whether this would work for Dick's Sporting Goods.

The short answer? **Yes.**

- The youth sports market is gigantic: **28M youth athletes, $15.5B market** that is likely to more than double (to $41.23B) by 2023.
- DICK’s has an initiative to save youth sports teams that are less fortunate. This showed that the client had a good understanding of the space.
- DICK’s recently acquired TeamSports HQ (a digital platform that utilizes a variety of applications to ease the youth sports experience) that already has a large user base: **7M+ youth athletes and 1.5M+ youth coaches**. This showed that the client was shifting their focus to youth sports.

#### Phase 3: User Research

This next phase was aimed at finding out more about the pain points specific to the youth sports space, and verifying our secondary research from Phase 2.

<blockquote>
	<b>Research methods:</b> Survey, in-person interviews with youth coaches, youth athletes, and parents, guerrilla research
	<br />
	<b>Synthesis methods:</b> Affinity diagramming
</blockquote>

From our guerilla research with 7 coaches, 2 athletes and 2 parents, we found the following insights:

**The role of the youth coach is to:**
- Provides expertise in skills for the sport itself.
- Teaches fundamental skills for life.
- Serves as a role model or even a parent type figure.

**Youth coaches' key pain points are that:**
- Parent’s toxic behaviors and expectations discourage youth athletes from continuing the sport.
- New coaches lack experience in organizing effective practices.
- Coaches have limited time and attention to give all their athletes.
- Athletes have uncertainty of their coaches’ big picture during practices, draining their commitment to the sport.

Only after these three phases had we found a proper project focus:

<blockquote>
	To lengthen the athletic lifespan of youth athletes by empowering coaches’ abilities to address pain points that drive athletes out of the mastery loop.
</blockquote>

#### Phase 4: Exploration

This phase can be split into two sub-phases: ideation / rapid prototyping in divergence, and experience design and user testing in convergence.

<blockquote>
	<b>Methods:</b> Rapid ideation, storyboarding, speed dating, concept pitching, usability testing
</blockquote>

##### Phase 4A: Ideation

{% include project-image.html src='img/DSG University-8.png' description='From offline to online, no ideas are bad in the ideation phase!<br/> Our wackiest idea included parents being coached by the kids.' %}

Based on the 4 pain points from phase 3, the team rapidly ideated 40+ ideas and found some trends in the ideas. We picked 8 ideas that seemed to capture these trends and conducted 5 speed dating sessions with storyboards.

{% include project-image.html src='img/DSG University-9.png' description='Speed dating sessions were coordinated with youth athletes and their parents.' %}

These sessions gave us 5 key insights:

- Coaches of all levels need to constantly research new drills to add to their practice plans.
- Videos explaining the drill helps coaches learn how to conduct the drill.
- Parents volunteer to take care of the youth teams when coaches aren’t available.
- Kids question why they are doing certain drills — i.e.: “Why am I running so much!”
- Youth athletes are hugely motivated by sport celebrities — i.e.: “I want to play just like Steph Curry!”

These insights helped us narrow down our 40+ ideas to 5 final ones.

- **Mentorship Program:** On & off field relationship between experienced and beginner athletes
- **ExpShare:** Peer to peer, anonymous experience sharing platform for teams
- **Dick’s Sporting Goods University:** Training management tool & library of drills created by sport celebrities
- **Drill HQ:** Library of drills created by the top youth coaches
- **Drill Share:** Crowd-sourced platform for coaches and athletes to share drills

The only problem was that each of our 5 team members liked a different idea. We agreed that the challenge was that we couldn't see what each other was thinking. To get around this, we thought: *"why not show each other what we're thinking?"*

We did this through a *"pitch battle"* format, where each of us scoped out the targeted pain points, value for main stakeholders, key features, 3 low-fi wireframes, feasibility, success criteria, timeline, and challenges for each idea.

{% include project-image.html src='img/DSG University-10.png' description='Me pitching DSG University to my teammates!' %}

In the end, we chose DSG University for its:

- **Desirability:** Could potentially target all 4 pain points from phase 3
- **Feasibility:** Online service that leverages client's existing connections and resources
- **Viability:** Provides client with multiple new revenue streams

##### Phase 4B: Experience Design

We took this winning pitch to our client and conducted a co-design session to figure out how this project could look in the end.

{% include project-image.html src='img/DSG University-11.gif' description="Co-design session with DSG's designers" %}

We then took all the ideas from our meeting and diverged once more, sketching multiple versions of lo-fi screens.

{% include project-image.html src='img/DSG University-12.gif' description='Just some of our countless lo-fi iterations.' %}

We then met as a team to consolidate all screens, then iterated a countless number of times to arrive at our final prototype. 

#### Final Solution Walkthrough

Below is the prototype walkthrough section of our final presentation.

Overall, the concept provides value to:

**Dick's Sporting Goods:**
- Brand DICK’s as a sports authority
- Becomes a go to place for drills and plans
- Provides financial benefit with a subscription based model

**For the coach:**
- Helps new coaches have an easier time coming up with interesting drills
- Provides an opportunity to get to know other coaches online

**For the athlete:**
- Be happier about the number of drills & games they get to play during their practice.
- Be inspired by their hero athlete celebrities and thus, less likely to drop out from the sport.
- Track their progress against their heroes' suggestions

#### Reflection

As the owner of the idea in phase 4A, I still feel very attached to the idea. I hope Dick's Sporting Goods pilot works out and that they decide to move forward with this idea in the future, as I truly believe this can help Dick's Sporting Goods make an industry-shifting impact. This was one of the best team project experiences I've had to date, and I want to thank all my teammates for such a great time.
