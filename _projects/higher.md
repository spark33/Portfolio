### Higher decentralizes the hiring process using an online platform, making processes smarter, faster and fairer.

My Information Systems capstone team worked with Deloitte mentors to design / prototype an innovation that would target the next <a href="http://ideagenius.com/the-s-curve-pattern-of-innovation-a-full-analysis/" target="_blank">'S-curve'</a> of an industry. We moved through this project in 5 main phases, starting with problem identification.

#### Phase 1: Where do we innovate?

Because the project wasn't scoped, we didn't know what industry to target. To narrow down, we decided to choose a domain we knew personally as college students-- the job application process.

No innovation can be feasible or desirable without targeting specific pain points. We ideated and grouped them by stakeholder:

##### Applicants
- Applicants don't know why they were rejected
- Decisions often feel unfair for applicants
- During consideration, they don't know where they stand
<br/>
⋮

##### Reviewer
- In-person interviews are expensive for companies
- Ineffective interviewing processes means they lose out on the best talent
<br/>
⋮

We had so many pain points that we didn't know where to start. To organize our pain points, we came up with the following 5-phase framework:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/website-v2/img/Higher-1.png" />

We then did a competitive analysis to assess what solutions exist for each phase today:

Based on our <a href="https://ideal.com/ai-recruiting/" target="_blank">research</a>, we found the biggest opportunity in the application review phase:

- **52%** of Talent Acquisition leaders say that the hardest part of recruitment is screening candidates from a large applicant pool.
- **56%** of Talent Acquisition leaders in 2017 said that their hiring volume will increase in 2018.
- **66%** of Talent Acquisition leaders in 2017 said their recruiting teams are staying the same in size in 2018.

Many companies and news outlets called the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/11/how-goldman-sachs-is-pursuing-the-holy-grail-of-hiring.html" target="_blank">"holy grail"</a> of recruitment: how quickly can you pick the best candidate in the haystack of resumes?

#### Phase 2: Defining the solution

We found that companies like <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G" target="_blank">Amazon had tried to innovate in this space</a> and failed spectacularly because they had tried to fully automate the process. We learned that **full automation may not be feasible**, and explored other avenues of innovation.

So, we went back to this idea of *justifying* the decision. If we could justify every decision, this could be a huge breakthrough in introducing transparency, and allowing companies to make the 'best' selections possible. So we tried to quantify a rating for each candidate, but with less automation to avoid failing like Amazon.

So what was the right balance of automation and manual processing?

We found a solution in designing a *human-data-driven decision-making process* to address this problem. We found research to suggest that <a href="http://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/papers/OneAndDone.pdf" target="_blank">a large number of decision-makers could lead to optimal decisions</a> by removing personal biases. We decided to move quickly to prototype and test our stakeholders in industry thought. We also found research that <a href="http://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/papers/OneAndDone.pdf" target="_blank">minimizing the number of choices</a> could yield optimal decisions. 

We decided to combine these two research topics together. Once we had our solution, we jumped straight into designing wireframes to test with professionals in the HR industry.

#### Phase 3: Lo-fi + Testing

Given our limited time, we had to prioritize the tasks to prototype. We created a user flow for the main user story that resulted in a decision about a candidate to assess key tasks.

We chose to design lo-fi wireframes for the review, comparison and evaluation steps. We then made a clickable prototype on inVision and conducted some basic interviews with professional with HR experience on the value that this platform would provide. Overall, we received overwhelmingly positive feedback:

<blockquote>
	I like that the decision has been narrowed down to two applications-- as a user, that would be much easier than picking 1 from 20.
	<i>- Hiring designer at fashion startup</i>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	It feels like I'm getting just the information I need at each stage. Feels clean.
	<i>- News startup founder</i>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	I like that I can get many eyes on an application before a decision is made. More eyes, more objectivity.
	<i>- Consulting hiring project manager</i>
</blockquote>


While we received positive responses overall, we also got some critical feedback to push us forward to the hi-fi stage.

#### Phase 4: Hi-fi + Value Prop

In our hi-fi phase, we added color, data visualizations and supplementary screens to complete the user journey. You can explore our inVision prototype <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/86OVNMGQ9UN#/screens/328779598_Home" target="_blank">here</a>.

The final project and all of its research was presented in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tfjfqCQnSq6NHi5LoQcow_V86qcDEWar3MVMiIE_Chw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">presentation</a> to our professors and Deloitte mentors. The focus of the presentation was to demonstrate not only how Higher functioned but also how it provided to its potential clients:

	</div>
	<a class="slider-button slider-prev-button"><span></span></a>
	<a class="slider-button slider-next-button"><span></span></a>
</div>

Below is a summary of the solution presented:

<blockquote>
	<a href="https://ideal.com/ai-recruiting/" target="_blank">52% of talent acquisition leaders agree</a> that the toughest challenge with hiring is selecting the best candidate from a pool of applications. The process is not only long and expensive, but also sometimes biased and ineffective.

	<br/><br/>

	Take a large corporation with multiple offices around the country. At each office, a recruiting team sits around a table discusses the applications one by one. The consideration of each application slowly becomes driven by the preferences of those sitting around the table, and the dynamics of the discussion.

	<br/><br/>

	Higher digitizes this ineffective discussion into a fair, streamlined, voting process. It allows employees around the world to log on, review applications and vote for the better of two candidates.

	<br/><br/>

	Involving more decision-makers removes biases, and digitzing the experience generates data that HR professionals can leverage to make effective decisions.
</blockquote>

The final presentation was a success and one of our Deloitte mentors, who knew I had interned at Deloitte, suggested that I consider exploring this idea further as an initiative within the firm! I will be considering this possibility further as I get settled into life at the company.
