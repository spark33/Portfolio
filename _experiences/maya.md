### I served 6 different clients at BCG Platinion (MAYA Design), working in software development, UX design and user research.

MAYA Design is a digital innovation lab with a human-centered focus in design and research. I worked on 2-3 projects at any given time, working on anything from PHP back-end development to creating prototypes in inVision, or writing prototype demo reports in inDesign.

#### Projects

- Developed front-end for administrator interface, PDF exports, print-friendly pages and content pages in PHP (Kirby)
- Drove 3 iterations of med-fi to high-fi inVision prototypes, creating reports and presenting updates to the client weekly
- Wrote usability testing interview script and assisted with user research interviews
- Fixed bugs in time & expense system in EmberJS

While I can't publish my project work publicly, I would be happy to talk about any of these projects.
