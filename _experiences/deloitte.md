### I am looking to specialize in delivering digital user experiences through UX design and full-stack development at Deloitte.

After spending a summer as a Summer Scholar (or intern), I joined Deloitte in September 2019. I've only just joined the firm, but I would be happy to answer any questions about the company, my internship project or the Summer Scholar program!
