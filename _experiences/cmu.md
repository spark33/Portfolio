### Carnegie Mellon was where I learned everything I know professionally.

I graduated in May 2019 with majors in Information Systems and Human-Computer Interaction. I gained technical skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript (jQuery, React), Ruby (Jekyll, Rails), wireframing, prototyping and user research. I've gained leadership experience through my various organizations, and I've made some amazing friends.

Professionally, I was involved with 6 different campus jobs, notably as a web developer for the Eberly Educational Tech center and as a personnel manager for the computer lab management services.

I've also had the chance to work with many clients in the area through my involvement with AT Kearney Student Lab program, Human-Computer Interaction Institute, the Undergraduate Consulting Club and Information Systems program..
